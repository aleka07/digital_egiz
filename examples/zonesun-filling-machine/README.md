# Zonesun ZS-XYZ Filling Machine Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Digital Egiz framework with a simulated Zonesun ZS-XYZ Filling Machine. It includes a data simulator, pre-defined twin type, 3D model with data bindings, and ML integration for anomaly detection.

## Components

- **Data Simulator**: Generates realistic machine data for testing and demonstration
- **Twin Type Definition**: Pre-configured digital twin type specific to filling machines
- **3D Model**: Interactive 3D visualization of the filling machine with data bindings
- **ML Integration**: Example anomaly detection model for predictive maintenance

## Setup

1. Ensure the main Digital Egiz services are running:
   ```
   cd ../../docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Start the Zonesun example services:
   ```
   cd ../examples/zonesun-filling-machine
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
   ```

3. Access the UI at http://localhost:3000 and log in with:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin

4. Navigate to the "Example Project" where the Zonesun Filling Machine twin will already be configured.

## Data Simulation

The simulator generates the following data:

- **Temperature**: Simulated temperature readings from various machine components (20-80Â°C)
- **Pressure**: Simulated pressure readings from the filling system (0.5-5.0 bar)
- **Fill Level**: Current level of liquid in the reservoir (0-100%)
- **Vibration**: Vibration levels indicating machine health (0.01-2.0 g)
- **Flow Rate**: Rate of liquid flow during filling operations (0-5.0 L/min)
- **Motor Speed**: RPM of main drive motors (0-3000 RPM)
- **Bottle Counter**: Number of bottles processed
- **Bottle Rejected**: Count of bottles rejected for quality issues
- **Status**: Operational status (idle, running, error, maintenance)
- **Error Codes**: Any active error codes

## 3D Model Interactions

The 3D model visualization includes:

- **Color-coded components**: Machine parts change color based on temperature
- **Moving parts**: Visualize machine motion during operation
- **Indicators**: Status lights reflect current machine state
- **Interactive elements**: Click on components to view detailed information
- **Real-time updates**: Model updates based on live data

## ML Integration

The example demonstrates machine learning integration for:

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in sensor data
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Estimates remaining useful life of components
- **Quality Control**: Predicts potential quality issues based on machine parameters

## Customization

You can modify the simulator behavior by editing the configuration files in the `config` directory:

- `machine_config.json`: Machine parameters and constraints
- `simulation_config.json`: Simulation behavior and data generation settings

## API Access

The example exposes the following API endpoints:

- Digital Twin API: http://localhost:8080/api/2/things/zonesun:filling-machine-01
- ML Predictions: http://localhost:8000/predict/anomaly_detection

## Developing Your Own Example

This example serves as a template for creating your own digital twin implementations. Key steps:

1. Define your twin type in the database
2. Create a data simulator or connector to real device
3. Configure the 3D model and data bindings
4. Set up ML models relevant to your application
